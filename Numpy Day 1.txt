# # Numpy
# - core library for scientific and numerical computing in python
# - linear algebra, Fourier Transform
# - provides high performance multidimensional array object and tools for working with arrays
# - main object  is the multidimensional array
# - t is a table of elements (usually numbers) , of same data type, indexed by a tuple of positive integers
# - dimensions = axes
# - numpy arrays aka ND arrays

# ### Why Numpy and not lists?
# - Fast - have been optimized for years and thus implementation is quick
# - Convienient - has different libraries from python lists and more no. of functionalities
# - Less Memory
